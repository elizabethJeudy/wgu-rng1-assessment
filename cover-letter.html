						<p><strong>To Whom it May Concern,</strong></p>
						I am writing to express my interest in the
						<mark>Junior Software Developer</mark>
						position with this company. With a background in psychology and a
						current pursuit of a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering at Western
						Governors University, I bring a unique blend of empathy, analytical
						thinking, and technical curiosity. I am passionate about building
						applications that have meaningful impact—solutions that are not only
						functional but thoughtfully designed with the user in mind. My
						journey into software development has been driven by a genuine
						eagerness to learn and grow. I’m constantly expanding my skills in
						HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java, and I approach each day as
						an opportunity to improve. My love for reading fuels both my
						creativity and discipline, and I thrive when challenged to solve
						complex problems or learn new technologies. I’m excited about the
						possibility of contributing to a team that values innovation,
						collaboration, and continuous improvement. Thank you for considering
						my application. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my passion
						and dedication to your team, and I look forward to the possibility
						of an interview.
						<p>Sincerely,</p>
						<p>Elizabeth Jeudy</p>
